# kickass

A simple, modular and minimal .js framework consisting 
of optional components rewritten from scratch to 
leverage the power of modern browsers. The goal for each 
component is to "do one thing and do it well." Include 
only what you need.

## Windows-like Components

These components allow forms, web apps or "widgets" to 
behave like miniature desktop windows inside the web 
page. They give users improved control over content, so 
they can reposition forms when using different-sized 
on-screen keyboards, for example.

 * Decorator  - fancy borders (todo)
 * Draggable - make elements movable, draggable
 * Minimize - minimize widgets (todo)
 
Each component comes with an HTML tutorial walking 
through each step to effectively deploy it on a web 
page. Some components emit custom events, allowing 
scripts to perform actions based on user interaction 
such as dragging or moving the form.
