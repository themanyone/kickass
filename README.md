## One Module

When completed, just include one simple module loader on the page. No additional CSS or anything will be required. But this project is fairly new and far from complete.

## Widget Features

Widgets give users and developers improved control over content, so they can reposition forms when using odd-sized on-screen keyboards, for example.

 * Kickass   - main module pulls in others as needed
 * Widget    - turn a div into a fancy widget
 * Draggable - make elements draggable
 * Icons     - add close button + titlebar icons

Each component comes with an HTML tutorial walking through each step of creation, deployment and customization. Some components emit custom events, allowing scripts to perform actions based on user interaction, such as dragging or moving the form.

## Conveniences

kickass makes several conveniences available for tutorial makers. Repeat contents of tags, include HTML from other pages, and display parts of the page as syntax-highlighted code.

 * data-echo feature echos code from other elements.
 * data-include attribute includes data from another page.
 * data-code inserts named script or CSS contents
