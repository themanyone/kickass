# [Kickass](https://github.com/themanyone/kickass)

A .js widget library collection consisting of modular 
components rewritten from scratch to leverage the power 
of modern browsers. The goal for each optional component 
is to "do one thing and do it well." Include only the 
scripts you need for fast page loads and reduced code 
overlap, instead of using a bulky framework.

## Windows-like Components

These components allow forms, web apps or "widgets" to 
behave like miniature desktop windows inside the app or 
web page. They give users improved control over content, 
so they can reposition forms when using different-sized 
on-screen keyboards, for example.

 * Draggable - make draggable widget windows (done)
 * Minimize - close button + titlebar icons (done)
 * Decorator  - fancy borders (todo)
 
Each component comes with an HTML tutorial walking 
through each step to effectively deploy it on a web 
page. Some components emit custom events, allowing 
scripts to perform actions based on user interaction, 
such as dragging or moving the form.
