A simple, modular and minimal .js framework consisting 
of optional components rewritten from scratch to 
leverage the power of modern browsers. The goal for each 
component is to "do one thing and do it well." Include 
only what you need.

## Windows-like Components (growing list).

These components allow forms, web apps or "widgets" to 
behave like windows inside the web page. 

 * Window Decorator  - fancy borders for forms, widgets
 * Draggable Windows - make widgets movable, draggable
 * Maximize/Minimize - allow widgets to be minimized
 
Some components will emit custom events, allowing 
scripts to perform actions based on user interaction 
with windows/widgets.

Each component comes with an HTML tutorial walking 
through each step to effectively deploy it on a web page.
